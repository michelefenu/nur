# Nur Theme

**Nur** is inspired by the bold landscapes, luminous sunsets, and millennia-old heritage of the island of Sardinia. 

Rooted in ancient echoes of vibrant terracotta sunsets, mediterranean earth tones, ancient stone, crystalline shores, and the legendary nuraghe towers the theme brings a warm, relaxing, and accessible experience for long coding sessions.

The theme is currently available for **Visual Studio Code**, **Cursor**, and **Vim/Neovim**.
