Rooted in ancient echoes of vibrant terracotta sunsets, ancient stones, crystalline shores, and the millennia-old heritage of the island of Sardinia, the theme brings a warm, relaxing, and accessible experience for long coding sessions.

Relaxing for the eyes, accessible for the mind.

The theme is currently available for **Visual Studio Code**, **Cursor**, and **Vim/Neovim**.
